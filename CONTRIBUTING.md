# Contribution Guidelines

- If you are making a __quick__ change, push to `master.
- If you are making a __large__ change, create and push to an appropriate branch (`feature/log-caching` for a log caching feature, for example)
- If you make additional changes, push new commits to your branch. Do not squash your changes, that makes it extremely hard to see what youâ€™ve changed compared to the previous version of your pull request.
